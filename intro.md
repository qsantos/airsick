Kerbal Space Program @ksp is a rocket simulation game; it lets you build,
launch and pilot a rocket to put up satellites, send probes, land rovers, and
have Kerbals do SCIENCE.

Mouseover text reads ”To be fair, my job at NASA was working
on robots and didn't actually involve any orbital mechanics. The
small positive slope over that period is because it turns out
that if you hang around at NASA, you get in a lot of conversations
about space.” @xkcd1356

A big advantage a KSP player has over actual rocket crafters is that she can
have rockets exploding without having to worry about consequences.  Half the
fun of the game comes from finding out why your next rocket will fail; thus, I
urge you roll rockets to the launchpad early and not bother thinking of every
little thing that could go wrong.

Airsick will not cover the initiation to the game, since the interface is
specific to the game and prone to change. The game offers an intuitive way to
assemble rockets and has a handy interface to control the flight. Rather, it
will expose, explain and detail real principles of physics that the game
mimics. This information can be read simply for curiosity, or can serve to
design more precise launches in the game. When possible, example values will be
taken from reality or KSP.

<remark>
KSP is a propietary software. You can play the demo for free, but will be
limited to an older version with only a few parts available for building. The
demo is way harder and the complete game way richer.

This document is intended to provide information both for beginners and actual
physicists. The first few chapters are an introduction to the elementary
concepts used within this book. In every chapters accurate derivations and
complete proofs are developed wherevever needed. If you are not interested in
the specifics of a demonstration or have already some knowledge of basics
physics, feel free to skip irrelevant parts.
